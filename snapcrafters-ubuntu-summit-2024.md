# Snapcrafters: The leading community for snaps

Snapcrafters is a community of a bunch of volunteers who helps various small and big third party apps served into the snap store. This year was Ubuntu's 20th anniversary, and Snapcrafters got their first booth in the Ubuntu Summit 2024, hosted at The Hague, Netherlands. A very happening event it was, for Snapcrafters! Carrying forward the beacon from Heather, Lucy and Till, Snapcrafters also conducted their first workshop, "Snap Quickstart Guide 101". As the name suggests it was a quick guide how to make a snap package for an app. Merlijn and Soumyadeep from Snapcrafters leaded the workshop, where as Lucy, Till and Heather helped them by helping the attendees. The response was pretty amazing, many big and small upstream publishers joined and are now showing interest for a snap! (A big surprise below...)

Also, they have a robust CI system created and maintained by Jon Seager, Soumyadeep and many others of the community. After their debut workshop, they conducted another workshop about "How to build snaps directly from Github using Githun Actions", which again got the attention, and attendees very much enjoyed this!

### Show Casing Snap KCM

Until now, this seems to be a very productive conference for Snapcrafters right? They didn't stop here... Soumyadeep showcased the Snap KCM, the snap permission manager for KDE, and everyone liked the UI and the implementation. Alex Lowe from Canonical setup a daily ppa for the project which you can also give a try in your Ubuntu 24.10+ installation.

### Fixing theming in KDE snaps

Soumyadeep also discussed with Eric, Sergio and Zyga on fixes of the theming for the snap packages in KDE and tried to get more towards the PR getting merged.


### Integrating Snapcrafters CI in the Gnome SDK repo

Soumyadeep and Merlijn discussed with Ken and Sebastian to get the Snapcrafters CI integrated into the Gnome SDK repo and other snaps that are maintained by the Desktop Team of Canonical! We're hoping for the best!

### Podcasting with Ubuntu

Soumyadeep with the suggestion of Merlijn and Till went ahead and made a plan for a Ubuntu Monthly Podcast in collaboration with Diogo from Ubunth Portugal. They also got a soft signal about help regarding storaging audio files from Canonical! You might get some insight informations from there!

### Snapping with Linux Gaming

And lastly and probably the biggest, Soumyadeep has collaborated with the Linux Gaming team to get snaps for their apps, and they already got the Heroic Snap up and running the summit itself! An awesome use of Hackerspace, it seems! One hopes that the Gaming team in collaboration with their Snap Magician can have some awesome things for the future of Gaming....

A very productive summit indeed! We hope that Snapcrafters can bring more such awesome work up in the table and we can have an awesome community around snaps! Sounds interesting? Wanna join them? Follow the link below and get your journey becoming a Snapcrafters rolling!
